## Description

Parkour LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) is a software package for sample processing and quality management of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and samples. Besides extensive functionality, most of existing LIMS are missing electronic laboratory notebook aspects to support, organize, and ultimately standardize initial laboratory-intensive sample preparation steps. The LIMS was designed to coordinate laboratory work by clearly structuring tasks and facilitate high-quality sample preparation. Deep sequencing users, laboratory personnel, and data managers will benefit from using Parkour LIMS as a central laboratory and quality management platform.

## Main Features

- Online sequencing request submission
- Real-time status tracking
- Coordinated sample preparation and instrument loading
- In-depth support of NGS workflows
- Quality control
- Reporting
- Interactive statistics on workflow usage
- Automated invoicing
- Standardized sample sheet generation
- Metadata export capabilities
- Highly customizable and extensible

## Installation

All installation steps are described in the [documentation](https://parkour.readthedocs.io/installation.html).

## Demo instance

A demonstration instance is available at [http://parkour-demo.ie-freiburg.mpg.de](http://parkour-demo.ie-freiburg.mpg.de). The following accounts are available on that instance:

 - A typical "staff" account with the username "parkour-staff@parkour-demo.ie-freiburg.mpg.de" and password "parkour-staff".
 - A typical "admin" account with the username "parkour-admin@parkour-demo.ie-freiburg.mpg.de" and password "parkour-admin".

Please note that the instance is reset every 12 hours!
